# Mastering Snowflake: Lessons from My First ELT Pipeline
*Oct 15, 2025*

**Tags**: Snowflake, ELT, Snowpipe

Snowpipe’s automation and Streams’ change tracking transformed my e-commerce data pipeline, but task scheduling required careful tuning. In my E-Commerce Sales Analytics project, I used Snowflake’s serverless Snowpipe for real-time data ingestion from AWS S3. Streams tracked incremental changes for efficient ELT, while Tasks automated transformations. A key lesson was optimizing task schedules to avoid performance bottlenecks, achieved by tuning warehouse sizes and query execution plans.
